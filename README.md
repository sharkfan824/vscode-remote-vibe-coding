## üìÇ What is vscode-remote-vibe-coding?

This application helps you use AI plugins in Visual Studio Code (VSCode) when working remotely. It operates through a local proxy to ensure you can access necessary tools without additional complexity.

- Windows 10 or later, or macOS.
- Visual Studio Code installed on your local machine.
- Basic internet connection for initial downloads.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Instructions

### üåê Setting Up Proxy for AI Plugins

To allow VSCode remote usage of AI plugins, follow these steps:

1. Open VSCode.
2. Navigate to the settings by clicking on the gear icon and selecting "Settings."
3. Search for `settings.json`.
4. Add the following configuration:

```json
{
  "http.proxy": "http://127.0.0.1:7890",
  "http.proxyStrictSSL": false
}
```

This will route all your requests through the local proxy running on port 7890.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Using Remote Servers

If you need remote servers to access the internet directly (using pip, git, wget, etc.), here‚Äôs how:

1. **Install mihomo/Clash**:

   Use the following commands in your remote terminal:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mihomo/clash-for-AutoDL.git
   cd clash-for-AutoDL
   ./install.sh
   ```

2. **Create Startup Script**:

   Create a script that starts automatically:

   ```bash
   echo "sh ~/clash-installation/start.sh" >> /etc/profile.d/99-clash-autostart.sh
   ```

3. **Update Proxy Functions**:

   Add a proxy functions library to your user directory:

   ```bash
   touch ~/.proxy_funcs.sh
   ```

4. **Change Bash Configuration**:

   Modify your `.bashrc` to include your proxy:

   ```bash
   echo "source ~/.proxy_funcs.sh" >> ~/.bashrc
   ```

5. **Verify Setup**:

   After configuring your setup, restart your system and check if the proxy runs correctly using:

   ```bash
   curl google.com
   ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Common Issues

1. **Unable to connect to the proxy**:
   - Check if the proxy server is running.
   - Ensure the port matches your `settings.json`.

2. **AI plugins not working**:
   - Ensure all configurations were applied as directed.
   - Restart VSCode after changes.

3. **Remote server unable to access the internet**:
   - Check your installation of mihomo/Clash.
   - Review your startup script for any errors.
